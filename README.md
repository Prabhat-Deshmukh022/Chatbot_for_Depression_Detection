# Chatbot_for_Depression_Detection

Welcome to our innovative platform dedicated to early detection of depression, crafted with care and expertise by our team for the Weal Health Hackathon. In today's fast-paced world, mental health awareness is more crucial than ever, and our mission is to provide a solution that empowers individuals to take proactive steps towards their well-being.

Our website utilizes a blend of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience. With a focus on accessibility and ease of use, our platform aims to reach a wide audience and offer valuable insights into one's mental health.

We have also integrated a chatbot in this project which uses large language models and fine tuning to create a chatbot which can speak with a user, determine whether or not they are depressed, and suggest verbal countermeasures after interacting with the user by asking a set of questions genearted by the bot .
